It works by determining a similarity measure between students ( which is inversely proportional to some chosen mathematical distance), computed from the data we have on them. That done, for any new student (having a set of features) we predict its need of intervention by looking at some of the most similar cases, and taking an average of their known outcomes. The number of cases inspected for this decision is somewhat flexible, just as the distance, and they depend on the problem. The intuition, however, is always the same: we expect the outcome of a given student to be similar to similar student's outcomes."
